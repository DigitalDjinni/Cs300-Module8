What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  In this course we were learning how to solve algorithms and how certain algorithms affected load times. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  When it came to my approach for the first 2 algoritms the vector and the hash table i had prior experience so i just read what was required of me and crushed it out. When it came to the last one the binary tree I had to refer to the book many times as well as watch a few youtube videos on this algorithm and finally got the understanding of it and got it to work.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  The only roadblocks i had was understanding the binary tree and the big O. To overcome this i just watched a few lectures on the topics on youtube while going through the book and i was able to finally wrap my head around it and get it to work.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  This project expanded my apporach to designing software by strengthing my skills in writing pseudocode as well as learning a new algorithm i didnt know about and showed me how different algorithms can create major runtime differences.

  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I always seem to make really great readable code or at least i think so, but this project did help me strengthen my pseudocode skills.
